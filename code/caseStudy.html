                            A Manager in an organisation figured out that team members are consistently confused as
                            to
                            what High Performance
                            Deliverables were. The root cause was Team Members were unable to relate to what to do
                            and
                            why they need to do it!

                            Skillfully applying “Asking Questions” and “Active Listening”, the Manager uncovered
                            individual issues and team issues.
                            Using the skill of “Contracting for Success” and “Setting High Performance Goals”, the
                            Manager then ensured commitment
                            to “minimum acceptable performance levels”. Along with this, the Manager also provide
                            feedback using techniques learnt
                            from “Giving and Receiving Feedback”

                            One of the Manager’s team member was not performing well. The Manager hesitated to

                            “hard” and “realistic”
                            feedback fearing backlash and negative impact. The Manager was also not comfortable

                            After going through our case studies and role-play practice in the program, the manager
                            realised that the key is to be
                            prepared. The manager gathered data points, feedback from stakeholders and the team
                            member’s
                            peers, and also considered
                            various behaviors that the team member displayed on the job. Armed with the confidence
                            of
                            being prepared, the manager
                            “confronted” the team member. Initially, there were “hiccups” in the conversation, and
                            the
                            conversation itself had to be
                            completed over a couple of days. But the manager finally managed to get through to the
                            team
                            member.

                            expected behavior and performance over the agreed upon 3 months. This lead to the team
                            members’ success and, also, had a

                            members as well as the manager continued to feel that it was not the best use of their

                            While going through the program, and as part of a practicum, the manager developed their

                            While going through the Effective Manager Journey, one of the key skills this manager
                            picked
                            up was how to Delegate. The
                            pre-read helped the manager understand the basic framework. Discussing within the
                            Learning
                            Circle helped clarify
                            concepts, interaction with the facilitator surfaced own “limitations”, “biases”, “fears”
                            etc. which stopped this manager
                            from practicing delegation. Practicums helped this manager take the first steps. Further
                            discussions within the Learning
                            Circle provided important feedback that sharpened self-awareness. Finally, Group
                            Training
                            with the Facilitator firmed up
                            this manager’s “action points on delegation”. “How to practice delegation” emerged due
                            to a
                            combination of all these
